			<h2>Bio</h2>
			I had recently completed the higher secondary education in 12th grade with a major subject as mathematics. After that, I took IELTS classes in Success overseas and manage to bring a 6.0 band for further studies. During my immigration file processing, I took classes for C language. I select Sheridan college for my further studies. I am good at counting. I like to watch cricket. My favorite player is Rohit Sharma. I like the Apple companies' product much than any other company. In the future I like to be an expert in coding.
